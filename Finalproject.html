    <h4>WHY IS GUN CONTROL NEEDED</h4>
<p >Hello my name is Suprem Lama, I am 19 years old. I graduated from Newtown High School and now i am majoring Animation in BMCC. Today i want to talk about gun control. One reason why i want to talk about this because people die every day in this world because of gun violence, robbery, internet trash talk and other. This is one of the main social problems because many people own guns and most of the guns people own aren't register. They buy gun illegally. Most of the people buy guns illegally so that if they kill someone police wont catch them. Buying guns illegally helps them to run away from that situation. Some people buy guns to harm themself, some does to to harm others and some buy guns for their own safty. If gun control was forced by the government there will be less % of people dying. This is one of the main topic i really wanted to talk about because we were only born with one life and one family. Once you die you will never come back to life and you will lose your family. World would be a better place if there was no such thing as gun, war and other. 90% of the people who attempt sucide with a fun die and this is no such thing to laugh about. Even a person under the age of 18 can buy illegally and when they do they only think about doing few things. Suicide because they are getting bullied by their friends or they are depressed. With gun control we shluld also raise awarness about bunnying or cyber bullying. In America according to few website 22,303 americas above the age of 18+ died in 2016 with a gun. This is only the people who are 18 plus now if we have to count the amount of death happening all around the world in a year by gun voilence, suicide and other it would be more than 100 thousand.With gun control being forced we will only have few % of people dying each year and we will save a lot of people lives. Gun control might already be a thing but is is doing nothing, people are still dying every day with gunand if we dont do something about it we will lose more lives. To make this happen we all citizens have to stand together and tell our government to foece this law. peoples life isnt something to joke about. Biggest Influencer have to raise awarness bout it.</p>
